# Weather_App
This Weather App uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap using an API. It displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon, with a background color that changes based on temperature. The app features a simple search interface for easy access.
